        <h3>Birds Of The Feather</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I want you to stay</li>
            <li>'Til I'm in the grave</li>
            <li>'Til I rot away, dead and buried</li>
            <li>'Til I'm in the casket you carry</li>
            <li>If you go, I'm going too, uh</li>
            <li>'Cause it was always you, alright</li>
            <li>And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me</li>
            <li>Nothing left to lose without my baby</li>
            <li>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know</li>
            <li>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone</li>
            <li>Can't change the weather, might not be forever</li>
            <li>But if it's forever, it's even better</li>
            <li>And I don't know what I'm crying for</li>
            <li>I don't think I could love you more</li>
            <li>It might not be long, but baby, I</li>
            <li>I'll love you 'til the day that I die</li>
            <li>'Til the day that I die</li>
            <li>'Til the light leaves my eyes</li>
            <li>'Til the day that I die</li>
            <li>I want you to see, hm</li>
            <li>How you look to me, hm</li>
            <li>You wouldn't believe if I told ya</li>
            <li>You would keep the compliments I throw ya</li>
            <li>But you're so full of shit, uh</li>
            <li>Tell me it's a bit, oh</li>
            <li>Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted</li>
            <li>Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid</li>
            <li>And I don't know what I'm crying for</li>
            <li>I don't think I could love you more</li>
            <li>Might not be long, but baby, I</li>
            <li>Don't wanna say goodbye</li>
            <li>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)</li>
            <li>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)</li>
            <li>Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)</li>
            <li>But if it's forever, it's even better</li>
            <li>I knew you in another life</li>
            <li>Had that same look in your eyes</li>
            <li>I love you, don't act so surprised</li>
        </ol>
